  # Hydra manages making parallel HTTP requests. This
  # is achieved by using libcurls multi interface:
  # http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/libcurl-multi.html
  # The benefits are that you don't have to worry running
  # the requests by yourself.
  #
  # Hydra will also handle how many requests you can
  # make in parallel. Things will get flakey if you
  # try to make too many requests at the same time.
  # The built in limit is 200. When more requests than
  # that are queued up, hydra will save them for later
  # and start the requests as others are finished. You
  # can raise or lower the concurrency limit through
  # the Hydra constructor.
  #
  # Regarding the asynchronous behavior of the hydra,
  # it is important to know that this is completely hidden
  # from the developer and you are free to apply
  # whatever technique you want to your code. That should not
  # conflict with libcurls internal concurrency mechanism.
  #
  # @example Use the hydra to do multiple requests.
  #   hydra = Typhoeus::Hydra.new
  #   requests = (0..9).map{ Typhoeus::Request.new("www.example.com") }
  #   requests.each{ |request| hydra.queue(request) }
  #   hydra.run
  #
  # @note Callbacks are going to delay the request
  #   execution.
